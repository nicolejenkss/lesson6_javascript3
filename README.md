### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (One concept I learned is DOM and the DOM tree. Each item on the DOM tree is a node. Also, the four aspects of a DOM are identification, traversal, tree manipulation, and Node Manipulation.)
2. (I learned about DOM document object methods. Common ones are getElementById, getElementsByTagName, getElementsByName, querySelector, and querySelectorAll.)
3. (Another concept I learned about is the history object. This keeps an internal list of all the documents opened in the current browser being used.)
